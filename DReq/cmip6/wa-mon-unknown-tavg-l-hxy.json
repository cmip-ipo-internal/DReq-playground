    "comment": "A velocity is a vector quantity. \"Upward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward (negative downward). Upward air velocity is the vertical component of the 3D air velocity vector. The standard name downward_air_velocity may be used for a vector component with the opposite sign convention."
