Isn't this just the product: area-mean sea ice thickness where sea_ice x sea_ice_area_fraction, or equivalently area-mean sea ice thickness where sea x sea_area_fraction? Or inconsistent with the explanatory comment, is it supposed to be sea ice thickness limited to an analysis of the sea portion of grid cells, in which case it would be area-mean sea ice thickness where sea (without multiplying by a fraction), or equivalently area-mean sea ice thickness where sea_ice x sea_ice_area_fraction / sea_area_fraction.  I think we should try to eiminate this variable.",
