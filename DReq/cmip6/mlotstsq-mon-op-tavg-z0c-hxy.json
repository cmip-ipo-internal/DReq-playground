    "comment": "The phrase \"square_of_X\" means X*X. The ocean mixed layer is the upper part of the ocean, regarded as being well-mixed. The base of the mixed layer defined by \"temperature\", \"sigma\", \"sigma_theta\", \"sigma_t\" or vertical diffusivity is the level at which the quantity indicated differs from its surface value by a certain amount. A coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable with standard name sea_water_sigma_t_difference can be used to specify the sigma_t criterion that determines the layer thickness. Sigma-t of sea water is the density of water at atmospheric pressure (i.e. the surface) having the same temperature and salinity, minus 1000 kg m-3. \"Thickness\" means the vertical extent of a layer."
