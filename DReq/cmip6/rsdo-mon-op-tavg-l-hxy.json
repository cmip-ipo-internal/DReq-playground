    "comment": "Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean \"net downward\".  When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called \"irradiance\".  In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called \"vector irradiance\".  In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.  \"shortwave\" means shortwave radiation."
