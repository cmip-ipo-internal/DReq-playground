    "comment": "\"Mole concentration at saturation\" means the mole concentration in a saturated solution. Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume, also called \"molarity\", and is used in the construction \"mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\"."
