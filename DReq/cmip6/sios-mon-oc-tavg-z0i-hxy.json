A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". \"Dissolved inorganic silicon\" means the sum of all inorganic silicon in solution (including silicic acid and its first dissociated anion SiO(OH)3-)."
