The precise distinction between \"fine\" and \"coarse\" is model dependent. \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area. The sum of the quantities with standard names surface_litter_mass_content_of_carbon and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_carbon has the standard name litter_mass_content_of_carbon."
