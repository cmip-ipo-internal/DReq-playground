    "questions_and_notes": "The \"where snow over sea_ice\" directive is going to give weird results for regridded data that includes contributions from both sea ice and from land or land ice.  Also I don't think \"where area type\" can appear twice in a cell methods.  Finally, I might request \"where sea_ice\", with the thickness set to zero where there is no snow.  If we did this, we would need to know the fraction of sea-ice area covered by snow.  Think it better to request \"where sea ice\"",
