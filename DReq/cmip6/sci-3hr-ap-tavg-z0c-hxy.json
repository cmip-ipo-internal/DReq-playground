The CF standard name description says \"Time fraction\" means a fraction of a time interval. The interval in question must be specified by the values or bounds of the time coordinate variable associated with the data. \"X_time_fraction\" means the fraction of the time interval during which X occurs.\"  So, in cell_methods probably it should be time: mean, not time: point.",
