    "comment": "The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.   'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid. Aragonite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of aragonite is CaCO3. Standard names also exist for calcite, another polymorph of calcium carbonate."
