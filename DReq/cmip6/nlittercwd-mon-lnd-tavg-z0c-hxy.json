The precise distinction between \"fine\" and \"coarse\" is model dependent. The sum of the quantities with standard names wood_debris_mass_content_of_nitrogen, surface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen and subsurface_litter_mass_content_of_nitrogen is the total nitrogen mass content of dead plant material."
