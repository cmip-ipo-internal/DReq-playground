This would be used to calculate the total 'diabatic drag'. Contributions to this additional drag such Rayleigh friction and diffusion that can be calculated from the monthly mean wind fields should not be included, but details (e.g. coefficients) of the friction and/or diffusion used in the model should be provided separately."
