    "comment": "Picophytoplankton are phytoplankton of less than 2 micrometers in size. Phytoplankton are algae that grow where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. \"Nitrogen growth limitation\" means the ratio of the growth rate of a species population in the environment (where there is a finite availability of nitrogen) to the theoretical growth rate if there were no such limit on nitrogen availability."
