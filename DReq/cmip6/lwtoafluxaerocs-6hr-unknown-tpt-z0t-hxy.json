    "questions_and_notes": "The description is clearly wrong (downwelling LW is 0).  It is not clear whether this is the *difference* in radiation when the volcanic aerosols are removed or are added or whether it is the actual result of the second radiation call, but with aerosols removed (or added?). This should have a standard name like the ones proposed above. Consider using the term \"forcing\" as in some variables above.  Also, not clear why 6-hour sampling is appropriate for this variable (doesn't resolve diurnal cycle, so why not daily?)  And why is all-sky not requested (also or instead)?",
