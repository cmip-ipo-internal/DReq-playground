    "comment": "In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, \"flux\" implies per unit area, called \"flux density\" in physics.   'Sinking' is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding fluid."
